I am a second year PhD student located in Stuttgart, Germany.
My main focus is on Deep Generative Models in the context of autonomous driving.
I have been working with environment perception algorithms and 3D LiDAR data for over three years now.
The fast research pace in machine learning is fascinating and challenging for a young PhD student like me.

This website is currently under maintenance but will soon be available with all features.
