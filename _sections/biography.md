I received my M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from the University of Stuttgart, Germany, in 2018.
In 2016, I was a visiting research student at Centro de Informática at Universidade Federal de Pernambuco in Recife, Brazil.
Later, in 2017/18, I had a research project at the Laboratory for Future Interdisciplinary Research of Science and Technology at Tokyo Institute of Technology in Tokyo, Japan.

Since 2018 I have been working as a PhD Candidate in the field of environment perception at Mercedes-Benz R&D in Stuttgart, Germany.
The academic supervision is by Prof. Marius Zöllner from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany.
My current work focuses on 3D deep generative models and LiDAR-based scene understanding for self-driving cars.
