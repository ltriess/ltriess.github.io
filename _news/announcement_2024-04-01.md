For the first time in many years the new semester also starts for me - but this time as lecturer of the course "Advanced Visual Processing" at the University of Stuttgart 👩‍🏫 

This course is directed to students in their Master's curriculum and covers advanced digital image processing with applications in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Automated Driving.

The first part of the course discusses fundamentals in digital image processing, including image acquisition and representation, image sampling and quantization, noise reduction and restauration.

The second part of this course presents technologies used in modern computer vision systems. This includes feature extraction, segmentation, classification, and detection, as well as an overview on state-of-the-art techniques that use deep neural networks (DNNs).

I'm looking forward to this new experience and hope that many interested students will join the lecture from next week on! 👩‍🎓
