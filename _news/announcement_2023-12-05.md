Yesterday was the first meeting of the advisory board of the Leadership Talent Lab (LTL) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).
I was recently appointed member of this board as one of the alumni of the Leadership Talent Academy (LTA).

I'm happy to support the leadership education at the KIT und bring in my perspective as an alumna of the program who is going her first steps towards leadership herself now.
Here you can find more information about the [LTL](https://www.hoc.kit.edu/ltl.php) and the [LTA](https://www.irm.kit.edu/Leadership_Talent_Academy.php).
