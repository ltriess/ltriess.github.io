I held my first lecture together with my colleague Sebastian Krebs.
We each did one of the 1.5 hour parts of the lecture "Digital Image Processing" at the University of Stuttgart.
The lecture is normally held by [Fabian Flohr](https://fabian-flohr.de).

It was a great new experience for me.
Of course I was a bit nervous at the beginning, but I soon realized that it is easy and fun to explain technical details to others, especially if you have a good understanding of the subject.
Luckily my part of the lecture was about (Convolutional) Neural Networks, which felt like a homerun.

I hope the students feel the same and got at least the gist of the lecture (it was really hot and hard to stay concentrated in that room).
Also it is nice to spark some interest in our field of environment perception for automated driving.

Looking forward to more such new experiences. ðŸ’ª
