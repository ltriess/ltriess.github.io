Our perception teams from Mercedes-Benz AG were at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) in Paris last week ðŸ“·

I went there together with my colleagues Fabian Poggenhans, Peizheng Li, Shuxiao Ding, Vitali Kaiser, You Zhou, Andrea Ramazzina, and Stefanie Walz.

In addition to networking and discussing about cool new research, some of us also presented our latest research in the area of automated driving in form of three papers:
