Starting with this year's summer semester, I will be teaching the lecture "Advanced Visual Processing". The lecture is formely known as "Digital Image Processing" and was held by Fabian Flohr in the last few years.

In my introductory talk, I explained the basic maths of convolutions, stated the differences to convolutions used in neural networks for image processing, and then concluded with a variety of applications and research fields from automated driving.

For me this is a great opporunity to re-connect with my alma mater and I'm looking forward to this new and exciting journey.
