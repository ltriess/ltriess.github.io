Next week, I will give a lecture on Scene Understanding for Autonomous Driving at the Hochschule München.

The lecture is part of an industry track where various companies present their current topics over the duration of the entire semester. Thanks to [Fabian Flohr](https://fabian-flohr.de) who invited me to join this event series.

When I was a student, I enjoyed these kind of lectures. They gave me the opportunity to get to know on what topics companies are currently working. But more importantly it also gave me insights into how they are working on it and what skills might be required.

I'm happy to share my knowledge to the next generation of students and answer many questions. I also look forward to give an overview on the topics we are working on in the field of automated driving here at Mercedes-Benz AG.
