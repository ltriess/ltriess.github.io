I use machine learning to make autonomous vehicles perceive and understand their environment.

I am a Machine Learning Engineer in the Scene Understanding Group at Mercedes-Benz R&D. As a Product Owner, I am responsible for the Perception, Fusion, and Prediction for the next generation of highly automated vehicles.

Previously, I was a PhD student with the LiDAR Perception Group at Mercedes-Benz R&D and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), where I was advised by [Prof. J. Marius Zöllner](https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/J._Marius_Zöllner). My research is published under the title "[LiDAR Domain Adaptation - Automotive 3D Scene Understanding](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000158328)".
