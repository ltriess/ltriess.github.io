I use machine learning to make autonomous vehicles perceive and understand their environment.

I am a Machine Learning Engineer in the Scene Understanding Group at Mercedes-Benz R&D. I am technical lead of an international software development team for autonomous driving perception that works together with Nvidia to enable L3 high-speed driving on the highway.

At the same time, I am also lecturer at the University of Stuttgart where I am teaching the Master's course "Advanced Visual Processing" at the department of Electrical Engineering.

Previously, I was a PhD student with the LiDAR Perception Group at Mercedes-Benz R&D and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), where I was advised by [Prof. J. Marius Zöllner](https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/J._Marius_Zöllner). My research is published under the title "[LiDAR Domain Adaptation - Automotive 3D Scene Understanding](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000158328)".
