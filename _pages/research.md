## 2D and 3D Scene Understanding

My current research focus is on generic object recognition and deep learning for camera-based 3D scene understanding in complex urban environments.
A key aspect includes automatic label generation to enable scalable systems.

## Domain Adaptation and 3D Data Generation

The main research during my PhD involved domain adaptation for LiDAR-based perception systems.
Rather than re-labeling datasets for a variety of domains, the aim was to re-use data from other domains even if no labels were available.
