	<h3 id="languages">Programming and Development</h3>

		<p>
			My usual setup is a <i>zsh</i> terminal on an Ubuntu machine and my project opened in my favorite IDE <i>PyCharm</i>.
			I use <b>Python</b> on a daily basis and most of my <a href="https://github.com/ltriess">projects</a> are written in Python.
			Mostly, I use it in a combination with <b>TensorFlow</b> or <b>PyTorch</b> since a vast majority of my projects involve machine learning.
			However, I am also familiar with <b>C++</b> from my student jobs.
			For example, I implemented a lane detection on LiDAR point clouds with Caffe.
			The first programming language that I learned was <b>Java</b>.
			So far, I only implemented one project, a tile-based board game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)">Carcassonne</a>.
			During my studies at University, I used <b>Matlab</b> a lot, for example for my Bachelor Thesis project.

	<h3 id="competitions">Competitions</h3>

		<p>
			In the last two years I participated in some coding competitions.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<b><a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam">Google Code Jam</a></b>: It's my first year, so let's see how far I get...
			</li>
			<br>

			<li><b><a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode">Google Hash Code</a></b>:
				<ul>
					<li>2020: We had a new team strategy and made 824th place out of 10724 teams. Find our code on <a href="https://github.com/ltriess/hc20">GitHub</a>.</li>
					<li>2019: This was our first try as a team. Unfortunately, we only reached place 5075 out of 6640 teams.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<b><a href="advent.ieee.uni-passau.de">IEEE SB Passau Advent Calendar</a></b>:<br>
				A variety of simple to difficult coding puzzles in christmas themes with up to 50 participants.
				I participated in 2018 and 2019 and made it to the top 15 and 10, respectively.
			</li>
			<br>

			<li>
				<b><a href="https://www.zeiss.com/corporate/int/newsroom/events/zeiss-start-up-challenge">ZEISS and KIT Robotics Innovation Competition</a></b> (2018):<br>
				A 24-hour hackathon in teams of four where we had to solve the cup game with a camera and a robot arm.
				We implemented a detection and tracking algorithm for our three cups and the ball.
				After shuffling the cups, we control the robot arm via ROS to lift the cup with the ball underneath.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<h3 id="courses">Courses</h3>

		<p>
			I had the great opportunity to attend the <a href="https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/icvss2019/">International Computer Vision Summer School (ICVSS)</a> in summer 2019.
			It was an amazing experience, especially meeting all these great researchers in person.
			During my Bachelor and Master studies, I attended several lectures on mathematics, statistics, and stochastics.
			My start in machine learning was supported by some online courses on Coursera and the Deep Learning book.
