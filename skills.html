	<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>

		<p>
			My mother tongue is <b>German</b> and I speak <b>English</b> fluently.
			During my exchange semesters in Brazil and Japan I also learned a little bit of both languages.
			<br>
			However, I cannot only talk to humans, but also to computers.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Python</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; is the language I use on a daily basis. On <a href="https://github.com/ltriess">GitHub</a> you may find most of my projects written in Python.</li>
			<li><b>C++</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; In my student jobs I used C++ for my projects. For example, lane detection on LiDAR point clouds with <a href="https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/">Caffe</a>.</li>
			<li><b>Java</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; is the first programming language I learned. I programmed the tile-based board game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)">Carcassonne</a>.</li>
			<li><b>C</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; I only had one project, it involved developing an interface on a RasberryPi to confige a PHY.</li>
		</ul>

	<h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><b>TensorFlow</b> and <b>PyTorch</b> are my most used frameworks.</li>
			<li>I used <b>Matlab</b> for my Bachelor Thesis project on Human upper body detection and others.</li>
			<li>For development I use PyCharm and a terminal on an Ubuntu machine for which I configured custom <i>zshr</i> and <i>tmux</i> configs.</li>
		</ul>

	<h3 id="courses">Courses</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>I had the great opportunity to attend <a href="https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/icvss2019/">ICVSS</a> in summer 2019 which was an amazing experience.</li>
			<li>During my Bachelor and Master studies, I attended several lectures on mathematics, statistics, and stochastics.</li>
			<li>My start in machine learning was supported by some online courses on Coursera and the Deep Learning book.</li>
		</ul>


	<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

	<h3 id="competitions">Competitions</h3>

		<p>
			Every day after lunch, I play a round of clash of code with my colleagues on <a href="https://www.codingame.com/">CodinGame</a>.
			We are also a for <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode">Google Hash Code</a> and participated in 2019.
			However, we did not perform well.
			This year, we have a better strategy and hope to make it to the final round.
			The past two years, I liked to solve many problems of the IEEE SB Passau <a href="advent.ieee.uni-passau.de">Advent Calendar</a> and made it to the top 10 of the ranking.
			In 2018, I participated in the <a href="https://www.zeiss.com/corporate/int/newsroom/events/zeiss-start-up-challenge">ZEISS and KIT Robotics Innovation Competition</a> where we had to implement a tracking algorithm and control a robot arm via ROS.
			My team made second place.
