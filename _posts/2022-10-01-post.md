Last week I attended the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) in Tel Aviv, Israel. Check out my personal summary.

The conference were two big firsts for me:
1. Attending a major computer vision conference in person üçÄ
2. Travelling to Israel ‚úàÔ∏è

### Workshops
During the workshops in the first two days, I did workshop hopping in order to attend the talks I was interested in the most. However, sometimes schedules got mixed up and I missed the talk I intended to hear. In the end, I attended talks by Alexei Efros, Alex Kendall, Dragomir Anguelov, and others.

### Latest Trends on the Main Conference
- transformers are heavily on the rise
- language gets involved into all computer vision areas
- NERFs are hot and take over for GANs
- domain adaptation and open world scalability is highly discussed

### Some Personal Remarks
- Inside it's freezing cold - always pack a thick sweater when attending conferences in hot climate ‚ùÑÔ∏è
- Most relaxing workshop was the unofficial workshop of swimming in the Mediterranean Sea üêü
- Israeli food is great, but the hummus is a bit too bitter üç©
- The ECCV organizers really know how to party and make a great reception üé†

There are many more things to say. All together I'm grateful for the people I met and the new things I learned. I'm looking forward to the next in-person events.

Would I attend again? Yes, definitely!
