Today, I achieved a major milestone in my academic studies.
After 3.5 years of hard work, I finally handed in my dissertation thesis at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

Of course the work is not done yet, the defense is yet to come.
However, I feel the relief and am looking forward to my first free weekend in months.
Thanks to everyone who supported me along the way.
