Mohsen Sefati and I recently gave an interview on how important publicly funded projects are for our research team at Mercedes-Benz AG.
We reported about our experiences within the KI Delta Learning Project and explained how we can pursue innovative and challenging projects with the help of many partners.

If you want to know more about the project and our contributions, visit the [project page](https://www.ki-deltalearning.de).
