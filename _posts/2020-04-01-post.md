Today I received the notification that my paper was accepted at  <a href="https://2020.ieee-iv.org/">IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium 2020</a>.
I am very happy about the decision.
Most of the negative reviews pointed out shortcomings of the paper that were already known to me.
I guess there is always room for improvement at the stage of an initial submission.

The paper presents an approach that, unfortunately, did not work out as we hoped to.
One of the reviewers wrote
<blockquote>
    If the experimental result cannot verify the proposed method is better than the existing methods, I tend to remove the [...] contents.
</blockquote>

In my opinion failures are a part of research and therefore it is vital to include a new approach into a paper even though it did not beat the baseline.
The next person with the same idea can then see that it did not bring the desired results and does not have to waste his time on it.
Sadly, we usually have to beat a baseline to get a paper accepted at a conference.

The project page and preprint will be available soon.
