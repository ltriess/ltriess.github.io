Last week I presented our work on Semi Local Convolutions for LiDAR Scan Processing at the ICBINB workshop at NeurIPS.

I enjoyed the open discussions and found it particularly fascinating to freely discuss about "failed" research ideas.
Maybe every conference should have a track for good ideas that did not work out the way expected.
This may spark new ideas or generate progress in seemingly stuck research directions.
