Recently, my first patent was disclosed by the German Patent Office (<a href="https://depatisnet.dpma.de/DepatisNet/depatisnet?action=bibdat&docid=DE102019003621A1">DE102019003621A1</a>).
It was born from my Master's Thesis which was later published in my first paper "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00787">CNN-based synthesis of realistic high-resolution LiDAR data</a>".
I am looking forward to many more inventions, papers, and other publications.
This is only the beginning...
