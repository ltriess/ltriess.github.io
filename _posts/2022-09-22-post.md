I presented an overview on methods to transfer knowledge between driving domains to enhance scalability of autonomous driving. We also discussed the effectiveness of these methods, as evaluated in my research.

Information about the event can be found on [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/autonomous-driving).
