The 2019 [IEEE SB Passau Advent Calendar](https://advent.ieee.uni-passau.de) is over.
I enjoyed to participate and solve the coding puzzles, thus looking forward to the 2020 competition.
The problems seemed to be a bit more complicated than the year before, so let's see if they are going to get harder then.
My submitted solutions are on [GitHub](https://github.com/ltriess/IEEE_SB_Passau_Advent_Calendar_2019).
Though not complete, I got in the top ten.
