We just came back from our Taiwan vacation where we visited a friend of mine who is currently an exchange student in Taipeh.
Our route took us along the entire coast of Taiwan in counter clockwise direction.

Landing in Taipeh we headed south to Tainan where we did a nice bike tour.
We continued to Kaohsiung, the second largest city of Taiwan.
Here the photo on the left was taken in front of Dragon and Tiger Pagoda.
When traveling to the very south we stopped by Lambai Island and rented a scooter to find the best snorkeling spots.
In Kenting National Park we enjoyed hiking, snorkeling, relaxing on the beach, and eating delicacies at the night market.
After some days we took the bus to Taitung from where we took the ferry to Green Island.
Unfortunately, we felt the impact of a typhoon on the Philippines and had a bumpy ride but we made the best of it and went hiking instead of snorkeling.
After another bumpy road trip back we enjoyed the beauty of the small village Dulan.
We had a big hiking tour planned, due to rain and a lot of wind we had to turn around short before the peak.
Heading north, we stayed a few days in Hualien and enjoyed a whole day in Taroko Gorge with amazing views.
The last days, we spent in Taipeh.
Of course we did the obligatory Karaoke night there.

Taiwan is a very recommendable country for vacation, especially when you enjoy nature.
There are only very few tourists and it is very easy to make the entire tour with public transportation.
Hotels are quite cheap and it is easy to find a lot of great food for very low prices everywhere. 

We loved Taiwan.
