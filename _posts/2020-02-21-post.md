Yesterday, my team and I participated in the [Google Hash Code 2020](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode) competition.
We had a lot of fun solving the optimization problem and ranked 824 out of 10,724 participating teams worldwide.
Not the rank we hoped to achieve, but we made a big improvement compared to our first try last year.
Our goal is to reach the final round next year.
Wish us luck!

Now practicing for [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam) begins...

Our Hash Code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ltriess/hc20).
