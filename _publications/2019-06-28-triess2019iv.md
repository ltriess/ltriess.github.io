This paper presents a novel CNN-based approach for synthesizing high-resolution LiDAR point cloud data.
Our approach generates semantically and perceptually realistic results with guidance from specialized loss-functions.
First, we utilize a modified per-point loss that addresses missing LiDAR point measurements.
Second, we align the quality of our generated output with real-world sensor data by applying a perceptual loss.

In large-scale experiments on real-world datasets, we evaluate both the geometric accuracy and semantic segmentation performance using our generated data vs. ground truth.
In a mean opinion score testing we further assess the perceptual quality of our generated point clouds.
Our results demonstrate a significant quantitative and qualitative improvement in both geometry and semantics over traditional non CNN-based up-sampling methods.
